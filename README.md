 # DATASET DETECTIVE
 
 This repository was created as a test project. In the future, I plan to develop it into a full-featured website for dataset analysis and visualization.
 
 ## Current Structure
 - `dataset_detective.py`: Main script for dataset analysis
 - `data/`: Contains sample datasets (e.g., `sample.csv`)
 - `reports/`: Stores generated reports and visualizations (e.g., `missing_values_heatmap.png`)
 
 ## Future Plans
 - Build a web application for interactive dataset exploration
 - Add advanced data profiling and visualization features
 - Improve documentation and usability
 
 Feel free to check back for updates as development progresses!
